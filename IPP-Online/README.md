# IPP-Online

<b>Client:</b> Softgate Systems (IPP of America Inc.), US<br/>

<b>Project Description:</b><br/>

IPP Online is an online payment processing application used by the cash paying customers for paying 
bills such as mobile bills, credit card bills, water bills etc. IPP signs up independent retail merchants as 
authorized IPP Payment Centers to process consumer funded payments. These locations include 
supermarkets, convenience stores, pharmacies, check cashiers and wireless stores. Each retail location is 
connected to the IPP payment network by a payment terminal like a personal computer through the 
Internet.<br/>
 Customers come in with their bills and cash. The store clerk enters the bill payment transaction 
information into the device, collects the amount to be paid along with a small convenience fee and issues 
a computer-generated receipt to the customer. Utilities, water, cable, department stores, car-loans, credit 
cards, wireless services and many other bills can be paid. The same day that payments are made, payment
records are transferred electronically from the retail location to IPPâ€™s data center for electronic delivery to
the Billers.<br/>
