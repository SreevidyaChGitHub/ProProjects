<b>Client:</b> Bank of Nova Scotia, Toronto, Canada <br/>

<b>Project Description:</b>
Facility Link System is an existing application which serves Domestic customers i.e. Canada customers.
International Facility Link System is an application which is extended to support customers from other

The Authorized Facility amounts for International exposures are recorded in CARDS. The main objective
is to link the loan/ transaction records booked in International Loan, Retail and other Banking Systems to
its matching customer and facility information stored in the CARDS application to achieve a more
